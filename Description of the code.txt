I'll utilize the following elements and tools to meet the requirements for building a scalable and secure static web application in AWS.

AWS Materials

Hosting the static webpage on Amazon S3.
For SSL termination and content delivery, use Amazon CloudFront.
For SSL certificates, use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
Tool for Configuration Management:

I will automate the creation of AWS resources for this example using AWS CloudFormation.
Scripted tests:

For automated testing, Selenium WebDriver and java will be used.
Let's go over the steps to accomplish the goals:


I have created CloudFormation template that sets up the S3 bucket, CloudFront distribution, and SSL certificate which is shared in different file

I will use java and Selenium WebDriver to run automated tests. We may interact with web pages and check their content using Selenium WebDriver.


For Deploying stack :
I will Utilize the cloudformation-template.yaml file to build an AWS CloudFormation stack. To do this, you can make use of the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI. and Give the bucket a distinctive name when creating the stack.

To the S3 bucket I will  built with the CloudFormation stack, I will upload the index.html file.


TO run the automated test: I will install java and the required package. and run  the automated test.

The test should launch the browser, go to the web application, and verify that the phrase "Hello World!" appears on the page.

Monitoring and scaling:

 To keep an eye on the performance of S3 bucket, CloudFront distribution, and other AWS resources, we can use AWS CloudWatch. To get alerts for any concerns, you can set up alarms based on various criteria.

The architecture already uses CloudFront to scale the application, which scales automatically to accommodate traffic peaks and distribute content from edge locations. To lessen the strain on the origin (S3 bucket), we  can use CloudFront to cache material for a longer period of time if you anticipate exceptionally high traffic. You might also think about utilizing Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration to upload things to your S3 bucket more quickly.
